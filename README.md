# Background

This sample code is based on a part of my master’s thesis “Political Narratives and Social Norms” which explores the influence and complex interplay of narratives and social norms on economic and political behavior. 
Choosing this topic was largely motivated by the paper from Bursztyn, L., Egorov, G., Haaland, I., RAO, A., and ROTH, C. (2023, August), “Justifying Dissent”, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 138(3), 1403-1451.
As a part of my thesis, I replicated this paper by translating the Stata code used by the authors into R and showing that the shown results are obtainable. In addition, I also ran independent robustness checks (power calculations, heterogeneity analysis, model specification checks) to shed further light on the credibility of the results.
The sample code I will provide consists of the data cleaning process as well as the independent robustness checks.
